            <p>Welcome to DOA (Dropped Object Assessment). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "Application"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates.</p>

            <h2>Collection of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:</p>

            <h3>Personal Data</h3>
            <p>While using our Application, for users who subscribe to premium features, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Email address (for account creation, password recovery, and communication)</li>
                <li>Name (optional, for profile personalization)</li>

            </ul>
            <p>For free tier users, we collect minimal personal data, primarily non-identifiable usage data.</p>

            <h3>Usage Data</h3>
            <p>We may also collect information that your device sends whenever you use our Application ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Application, the time and date of your use of the Application, and other statistics.</p>
            <p>Specifically for the DOA app, this includes:</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>

            <h3>Assessment Data</h3>
            <p>When you create dropped object assessments, the data you input (e.g., object mass, drop height, location, hazard description, risk ratings, recommended actions) is stored.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> For all users, assessment data is primarily stored locally on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Storage (Premium Feature):</strong> If you are a premium subscriber and opt-in for cloud synchronization, your assessment data will be securely stored on cloud servers managed by our third-party provider (e.g., Firebase, AWS). This data is encrypted in transit and at rest.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Tracking & Cookies Data (If Applicable for Future Web Services)</h3>
            <p>Currently, the mobile application does not extensively use cookies. If we introduce web-based services or companion websites, we may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity and hold certain information. You will be notified if this changes.</p>

            <h2>Use of Your Information</h2>
            <p>Having accurate information about you permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Application to:</p>

                <li>Gather analysis or valuable information so that we can improve our Application.</li>
                <li>Detect, prevent and address technical issues.</li>
                <li>Compile anonymous statistical data and analysis for use internally or with third parties (e.g., industry trend reports, ensuring data is aggregated and anonymized).</li>
                <li>Enforce our terms, conditions, and policies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be disclosed as follows:</p>

            <h3>By Law or to Protect Rights</h3>
            <p>If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law, rule, or regulation.</p>

            <h3>Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
            <p>We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf, including payment processing (e.g., RevenueCat, Apple, Google), data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance. These third-party service providers are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For managing in-app subscriptions. Their privacy policy can be found on their website.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Hosting Providers (e.g., Firebase, AWS):</strong> For cloud storage and synchronization of assessment data for premium users. These providers have robust security measures in place.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>

            <h3>Aggregated or Anonymized Data</h3>
            <p>We may share aggregated or anonymized information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you, with partners or for public reporting (e.g., usage statistics, industry safety trends).</p>

            <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information and assessment data. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>
            <p>For data stored locally on your device, security is also dependent on your device's security measures (e.g., passcode, biometrics). For data synced to the cloud (premium feature), we rely on the security infrastructure of our chosen cloud providers, which typically includes encryption in transit (SSL/TLS) and at rest.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We will retain your Personal Data and Assessment Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
            <p>Assessment data stored locally remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the Application. Assessment data synced to the cloud (premium feature) will be retained as long as your premium account is active, or as otherwise required by law. You can request deletion of your cloud data by contacting us.</p>

            <h2>Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The right to access – You have the right to request copies of your personal data.</li>
                <li>The right to rectification – You have the right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or complete information you believe is incomplete.</li>
                <li>The right to erasure – You have the right to request that we erase your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
                <li>The right to restrict processing – You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
                <li>The right to object to processing – You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.</li>
                <li>The right to data portability – You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, under certain conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at our contact information below.</p>
