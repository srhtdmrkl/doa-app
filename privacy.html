            <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 text-center mb-8">Last Updated: <span id="lastUpdatedDate">May 10,
                    2025</span></p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you
                use our DOA (Dropped Object Assessment) mobile application (the "App").</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>

            <h3>Information You Provide Directly:</h3>
            <p><strong>Assessment Data:</strong> When you perform a dropped object assessment, you provide input such as
                object mass, drop height, units, description of the item/scenario, location details, current safety
                controls, and recommended additional controls.</p>
            <p><strong>Photos:</strong> You may choose to attach photos to your assessment documentation using your
                device's camera or gallery. Access to your camera or gallery is required only when you initiate this
                action.</p>
            <p><strong>PDF Customization Data:</strong> If you use the PDF customization features (potentially requiring
                a Pro subscription), you may provide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A company logo (uploaded from your device gallery).</li>
                <li>Company information text.</li>
                <li>A custom report title.</li>
                <li>Custom footer text for PDF reports.</li>
                <li>Custom section definitions (including title and field type like text or date).</li>
                <li>Data entered into custom sections you create (text, dates).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Feedback:</strong> If you choose to send feedback, you will initiate an email using your device's
                email client, and the content of that email will be sent to us.</p>

            <h3>Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
            <p><strong>Purchase Information (via RevenueCat):</strong> If you choose to purchase a Pro subscription, our
                third-party payment processor, RevenueCat, handles the transaction. We receive information from
                RevenueCat about your subscription status (e.g., whether you are a Pro user) to manage access to
                features. We do not directly process or store your credit card details. RevenueCat may collect
                information necessary to process payments and manage subscriptions, including anonymous or user-specific
                identifiers. Please refer to RevenueCat's Privacy Policy for details: <a
                    href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/</a></p>
            <p><strong>Usage Data (Potentially via RevenueCat):</strong> RevenueCat may collect anonymized or aggregated
                usage data related to subscriptions for their service provision.</p>
            <p><strong>Device Information (Implicit):</strong> Standard mobile application operations involve implicit
                collection of some device information by the operating system or underlying frameworks (e.g., device
                model, OS version for compatibility, storage access for saving data/logos). We do not actively collect
                or use device-specific identifiers for tracking beyond what is necessary for app functionality and
                purchase management via RevenueCat.</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To Provide App Functionality:</strong> To perform dropped object calculations, display
                    results, generate PDF assessment reports incorporating your provided data and photos, and allow
                    customization of reports.</li>
                <li><strong>To Manage Your Account and Subscriptions:</strong> To verify your subscription status (via
                    RevenueCat) and provide access to relevant features (e.g., Pro features).</li>
                <li><strong>To Store Your Preferences:</strong> To save your settings locally on your device, such as
                    PDF customization options (logo path, custom text, section order, visibility, titles, custom section
                    definitions).</li>
                <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> We may analyze aggregated, non-identifiable information to
                    understand how the App is used and to improve its features and usability.</li>
                <li><strong>To Respond to Feedback:</strong> To address your inquiries or feedback sent via email.</li>
                <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> To meet legal requirements or respond to lawful
                    requests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information under the following limited
                circumstances:</p>
            <h3>With Service Providers:</h3>
            <p>We share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For processing payments and managing subscription entitlements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>For PDF Generation/Sharing:</strong> The PDF reports generated contain the information you
                entered (assessment data, custom fields, company info, logo, photos). You explicitly control when and
                with whom you share these generated PDF files using your device's sharing capabilities.</p>

            <h3>For Legal Reasons:</h3>
            <p>We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good
                faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) enforce our Terms of Use, (b) detect,
                prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues, or (c) protect the rights, property,
                or safety of us, our users, or the public.</p>

            <h3>Business Transfers:</h3>
            <p>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets,
                your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>

            <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <h3>Local Storage:</h3>
            <p>Most of the data you provide (assessment inputs for PDF generation, settings, customization data, logo
                file path, custom section definitions) is stored locally on your device using standard application
                storage mechanisms (like SharedPreferences and the application's documents directory). Photos selected
                for documentation are processed for PDF generation and are not persistently stored by the App itself
                beyond the temporary files managed by the image picker/cropper or the generated PDF.</p>

            <h3>Cloud Storage:</h3>
            <p>We do not directly store your assessment data or personal information in the cloud, except for
                subscription status information managed by RevenueCat on their servers.</p>

            <h3>Security:</h3>
            <p>We implement reasonable measures to protect the information we handle. However, no security system is
                impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information stored locally on your
                device or transmitted to service providers like RevenueCat.</p>

            <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
            <h3>Accessing and Modifying Information:</h3>
            <p>You can typically modify the data used for PDF generation (like company info, custom text, custom section
                data) directly within the App's settings or input fields.</p>

            <h3>Deleting Information:</h3>
            <p>Assessment data entered for a specific PDF is generally not stored persistently by the app after PDF
                generation/preview. Locally stored settings (logo, custom text, company info, custom sections) can often
                be cleared or reset within the App's settings or by clearing the App's data via your device settings.
                Uninstalling the App will typically remove all locally stored data. To manage your subscription data
                held by RevenueCat, please refer to their policies and support channels.</p>

            <h3>Photos:</h3>
            <p>You control access to your camera and gallery via your device's permission settings. You can remove
                photos before generating a PDF.</p>

            <h3>Location Permissions:</h3>
            <p>The App does not request or use device location services. The "location" field is manually entered text.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you as
                required by law, possibly by posting the new policy in the App or on our website. Your continued use of
                the App after the effective date of the revised policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes.</p>

            <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>
