            <p class="mb-6 text-slate-700">
                Working at height comes with inherent risks, and one of the most serious is the danger of a dropped tool. A simple wrench or hammer falling from above can result in catastrophic injury or equipment damage. That's why a robust tool tethering program isn't just good practice—it's essential.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-6 text-slate-700">
                But a truly effective safety system is more than just a lanyard. It's a complete ecosystem where every component works in concert. Drawing from best practices like those outlined in the <a href="glossary.html#ansi-isea-121" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">ANSI/ISEA 121</a> standard, we can break down a proper tool tethering system into its three core pillars: the <a href="glossary.html#tool-attachments-attachment-points-on-tools-tool-traps" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">tool attachment</a>, the <a href="glossary.html#tool-lanyards-tethers-connectors" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">lanyard</a>, and the <a href="glossary.html#anchor-attachments-anchor-points-anchorage" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">anchor point</a>.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Part 1: The Foundation – Tool Attachments</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600">
                A tether is useless if it doesn't have a secure point to connect to on the tool itself. Since very few tools come with a built-in connection point, our first job is to create one. This process is often called "trapping" the tool, and it's the foundation of the entire system. A <a href="glossary.html#tool-attachments-attachment-points-on-tools-tool-traps" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">tool attachment</a> is any device retrofitted to a tool to create a load-rated tethering point.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600">
                There are generally two approaches to trapping a tool:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>One-Step Attachments:</strong> These are engineered, ready-to-go solutions. Think of specially designed brackets for power tools, durable sleeves that slide onto screwdrivers, or strong adhesive wraps for things like tape measures. They are designed for quick and reliable application.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-Step Attachments:</strong> This method offers more versatility. It typically involves creating a small connection loop (a "<a href="glossary.html#tool-tail" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">tool tail</a>") and then permanently securing it to the tool with specialized tape or a heat-shrink band. This creates a custom, low-profile attachment point.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4 mb-6 text-slate-700">
                Until a tool is properly "trapped" with a rated attachment, it's not safe for use at height.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Part 2: The Connection – Lanyards and Tethers</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600">
                The <a href="glossary.html#tool-lanyards-tethers-connectors" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">tool lanyard</a> is the vital link that connects the trapped tool to a secure anchor. It’s not a one-size-fits-all component; the right choice depends on the tool, the task, and the environment to ensure it enhances safety without hindering work.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600">
                You'll find several common styles, each with its own purpose:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4 text-slate-600 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Wrist Lanyards:</strong> Best for very light hand tools, these keep the drop distance to an absolute minimum.</li>
                <li><strong>Coil and Retractable Lanyards:</strong> A popular choice for preventing snags and tangles. They expand during use and retract when idle, keeping the work area clear.</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional Lanyards:</strong> These are simple, fixed-length straps or cables that are workhorses for a wide variety of tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Specialty Lanyards:</strong> You'll also find tethers designed specifically for items like hard hats, radios, or mobile phones.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4 mb-6 text-slate-700">
                The golden rule is simple: Always check the manufacturer's weight rating. The lanyard you choose must be rated to handle the full weight of the tool you're securing.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Part 3: The Secure Point – Anchors</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600">
                The final piece of the puzzle is the <a href="glossary.html#anchor-attachments-anchor-points-anchorage" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">anchor point</a>—where you connect your lanyard. The decision of where to anchor is governed by a critical safety rule based on the tool's weight.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600">
                <strong>Anchoring to a Person:</strong> For lighter tools (generally under 5 lbs or 2.3 kg), it's acceptable to anchor them directly to the worker. This could be a designated D-ring on a full-body harness, a strong tool belt, or a rated wristband.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600">
                <strong>Anchoring to a Structure:</strong> For heavier tools, the safety protocols are stricter. They must be anchored to an independent, fixed structure like scaffolding, a permanent railing, or a certified structural anchor point. This isn't just a recommendation; it's a critical step to prevent the force of a falling heavy object from injuring the worker.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 mb-6 text-slate-700">
                Solutions that create these connection points, whether on a person or a structure, are known as <a href="glossary.html#anchor-attachments-anchor-points-anchorage" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">Anchor Attachments</a>.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">A System is More Than the Sum of Its Parts</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600">
                It's crucial to view these three elements—the <a href="glossary.html#tool-attachments-attachment-points-on-tools-tool-traps" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">attachment</a>, the <a href="glossary.html#tool-lanyards-tethers-connectors" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">lanyard</a>, and the <a href="glossary.html#anchor-attachments-anchor-points-anchorage" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">anchor</a>—as a single, interconnected system. A failure in one component is a failure of the entire system.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-slate-600">
                When conducting a <a href="glossary.html#job-safety-analysis-jsa-job-hazard-analysis-jha" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline">Job Safety Analysis (JSA)</a> or a routine inspection, don't just glance for a lanyard. Verify that all three parts are present, are in good condition, and are being used correctly for the specific tool and task at hand. A well-implemented tethering program isn't about compliance; it's about a professional commitment to keeping everyone on site safe.
